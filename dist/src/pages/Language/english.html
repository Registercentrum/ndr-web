                <h3>The Swedish National Diabetes Register
                    (NDR) serves as a useful tool for providers
                    of everyday care</h3>
                <p><strong>Chronic diseases place a heavy burden not only on patients
                and their families, but on healthcare systems around the
                world. Such pressure on the infrastructure and organisation
                of the systems often leads to poor management of chronic
                conditions. The resulting complications reduce quality of
                life and dramatically increase healthcare costs.The personal
                and social repercussions are enormous.</strong>  Diabetes management
                has a number of dimensions, each of which is multifaceted
                in itself. Thus, patients should receive advice from
                a wide range of skilled professionals who are working
                together. A diabetes centre is an important resource that
                permits a multidisciplinary team to communicate effectively
                while providing consistent, reliable counselling. In
                addition, an individual care plan should be set up on the
                basis of the patient’s particular needs and circumstances.
                A clinical, practice-based population register can be used
                to support structural care and identify patients who may
                not be complying with their medication regimen, exposing
                them to risk of inadequate diabetes control.</p>

                <p>The NDR was launched in 1996 for the purpose of
                promoting evidence-based development of diabetes care
                by offering up-to-date information about changes in the
                treatment of glycaemia and other risk factors, as well as
                diabetic complications. Another aim is to support
                improvement in the quality of care provided by participating
                units at hospitals and primary care clinics. The
                overall objective is to reduce morbidity and mortality,
                as well as to maximise the cost-effectiveness of diabetes
                care. The NDR is maintained by the Swedish Society for
                Diabetology on behalf, and with the financial support,
                and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and
                Regions. The Swedish Diabetes Association, a patient
                advocacy group, actively uses the NDR as well.
                The NDR has been online since April 2002 (www.ndr.nu),
                allowing individual clinics to quickly monitor their
                activities on a regular basis by virtue of immediate
                access to their own results, as well as national statistics
                for purposes of comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                The NDR, which has been an integral part of Swedish
                diabetes care for the past 18 years, has engaged the
                participation of both hospitals and primary care clinics.
                The register offers a unique opportunity to monitor the
                quality of care in terms of risk factors and the potential
                complications of diabetes, as well as the evolution of
                treatment methods. The results generated by the register
                have been presented at many international meetings and
                conferences. To our knowledge, the NDR is the largest
                diabetes register in the world.
                </p>
                <p>Because the course of diabetes is complex and lifelong,
                both clinical practice and quality control of treatment
                measures must reflect systematic adherence to various
                guidelines. The NDR is an instrument to facilitate such
                monitoring and to disseminate findings in an accessible,
                transparent, comparable and timely manner. The register
                is both a repository of results and an educational tool for
                improving local quality assessment efforts. The register
                enables a focus on national quality indicators while following
                various process measures that are important at the
                local level. Diabetes care is largely self-managed. The
                NDR also promotes and facilitates the influence and
                participation of patients in their care and treatment. For
                example, patients can actively monitor data about their
                interactions with healthcare providers.
                Improved diabetes care minimises risk factors and the
                incidence of complications. The result is less human
                suffering and greater social cost benefits. The findings
                of the proposed projects may prove highly useful during
                an implementation process that involves continuous
                monitoring of the performance of an individual diabetes
                care unit.</p>

                <p>
                The NDR has established itself as a well-functioning tool
                to promote improvement efforts in the field of diabetes care.
                Documented evidence suggests that use of the register
                leads to better long-term outcomes. The critical factors
                for success are the emergence of healthcare systems in
                which measuring results is integral to the overall process,
                as well as training the entire team to participate in the
                improvement effort. Another factor that is crucial to the
                effectiveness of the project is the commitment of providers
                to measuring results, collecting data and discussing what
                they have learned.
                The NDR is used extensively throughout the country.
                NDR-IQ and other ongoing improvement projects ensure
                the promulgation of new working methods, along with
                evidence-based approaches to ensuring progress and
                improvement.</p>
